----

Exercises are completed by first removing implementations that begin with the
`error` function and substituting an implementation for that function. Functions
should then pass any tests that are written for that function.

Tests are identified by a comment beginning with `>>>` followed by an
expression. Evaluation that expression should produce the output that is given
on the next line (in a comment).

For example, when evaluating the expression `2 + 2` the output should be `4`.

    -- >>> 2 + 2
    -- 4

If an exercise passes all tests, but you believe (or even suspect) that you have
an incorrect answer, please open an issue on this github repository with those
details.
